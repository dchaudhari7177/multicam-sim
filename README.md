![Eight ring cameras render one moving object from eight angles; a red identity box tracks the same object across every view that sees it.](assets/multiview_hero.gif)

*multi-view: same object, 8 angles, one identity — eight ring cameras rendered by
the pure-numpy rasterizer, with the object's analytic projected box drawn in every
view that sees it. Reproduce: `uv run --with pillow python scripts/render_multiview_hero.py`.*

![Three MTMC camera stations with non-overlapping fields of view watch one object cross a corridor on a synced timeline; it hands off from camera 0 to 1 to 2, with blind-gap frames where no camera sees it.](docs/assets/hero_grid.gif)

*One object, three cameras with **disjoint** views, one timeline — a green border
means that camera sees it, red means blind. The gaps between stations are the
non-overlapping-coverage problem multicam-sim exists to benchmark. (Moving frames
are the Linux/Modal [Kubric photoreal path](docs/kubric-modal.md); the analytic
geometry, not the pixels, is the contract.)*

![A three-camera grid over time: each camera's projected box is coloured by the object's stable identity, the tile border is green while that camera sees the object and red while it is blind, and a timeline tracks the handoff from station A to station B.](docs/assets/multiview_demo.gif)

*The same handoff, annotated: each camera's projected box is coloured by the
object's stable identity, so one colour is one object across every view. A green
tile border means that camera sees it, red means blind, and the run walks the
object from station A through the blind gap into station B. Reproduce: `uv run
--with 'imageio[ffmpeg]' python scripts/record_multiview.py`.*

![A metrics panel: three per-camera bars showing detection precision 1.0 and recall equal to each camera's in-view coverage, next to a multi-view coverage summary giving union in-view fraction, frames seen, and blind-gap frame count.](docs/assets/multiview_metrics_sim.png)

*What the geometry tells you, straight from the sim's own ground truth. With no
occluders and exact projection, per-camera detection precision is structurally
1.0 and recall is just each camera's coverage (in-view frames / 15). The
scene-level story is the union: across all three cameras only 8/15 frames are
seen, leaving 7 blind-gap frames — that gap is the disjoint fields of view, not
occlusion, and it is exactly the non-overlapping-coverage problem this sim
exists to benchmark. Reproduce: `uv run --with 'imageio[ffmpeg]' python
scripts/record_multiview.py`.*

## Coverage and handoff reports

Any saved manifest can be reduced to one entity-frame sample at a time and
reported as JSON. Add `--panel` to render the same ground-truth metrics as a
headless PNG; matplotlib remains a lazy script-only dependency.

```bash
uv run python scripts/coverage_metrics.py scene.json
uv run --with matplotlib python scripts/coverage_metrics.py scene.json \
  --panel docs/assets/coverage_metrics.png
```

The panel combines per-camera coverage bars with overlap, handoff and blind-gap
totals. Its timeline makes the difference between one-camera coverage, overlapping
coverage and a true blind frame visible without using rendered pixels or an
external tracker.

**Can you recover a 3D point, or a human joint, when it is hidden in some camera
views but still seen in others — and can you tell what a person actually did to
which object?** multicam-sim builds the synthetic multi-camera scenes you need to
ask those questions with ground truth in hand.

Two shapes of scenario, one manifest: **non-overlapping coverage** (cameras with
disjoint fields of view, where an object hands off between stations and falls into
blind gaps) and **multi-station work-order / assembly-line** scenes (cameras aimed
at different regions of a station, where an operator's actions and the items they
move are only recoverable by fusing views). Both are domain-neutral and synthetic.

It sets up N calibrated pinhole cameras around a scene, moves objects (or a
skeleton) through it, decides for each camera which points are actually visible
versus occluded, and writes a single JSON **manifest**: the camera calibration,
the ground-truth 3D positions, every camera's 2D projection, and a per-point,
per-view visibility label. No renderer and no GL, just analytic projection and
boolean occlusion, so the geometry is exact.

## Assembly-line / work-order scenes

A second scenario shape: instead of one object crossing disjoint stations, an
**operator** assembles an **order** at a station while two cameras are aimed at
different regions — one framing the person, one framing the worktop. Their
per-entity `in_view` flags come out complementary, so recovering the whole job
means fusing views. The example also emits verified work-order ground truth
(`order.json`: `status` / `expected` / `placed` / `missing` / `extra` / `wrong`,
plus which joint placed what and when).

```bash
python examples/assembly_station.py                     # manifest.json + order.json
python examples/assembly_station.py --placement-synced  # + interactions.json
```

*Seeing the space: both camera frustums, the ground plane, and every entity's
ground-truth trajectory in one figure — the two cones cover clearly separate
volumes, which is the coverage split made visible. Reproduce: `uv run --with
matplotlib python scripts/view_scene_3d.py --manifest examples/out/manifest.json
--out docs/assets/assembly_station_scene_3d.png`.*

## What it produces

The manifest is the contract. For each frame and each named point it records:

- `xyz_gt` — the ground-truth 3D world position;
- `per_cam[i].uv` — that point's pixel in camera `i`;
- `per_cam[i].visible` — whether camera `i` really sees it (in front of the
  camera, inside the image, and not blocked by an occluder);
- `per_cam[i].occ_frac` — a continuous "how marginal is this occlusion" score.

Optional per-camera labels, opt-in so the default manifest stays byte-identical:

- `per_cam[i].visible_fraction` / `per_cam[i].occluded` — analytic image-space
  silhouette occlusion (the fraction of the object's disc a nearer occluder eats,
  and whether any does), emitted when you pass `object_radius=` to
  `build_manifest`;
- `per_cam[i].dropped` — a seeded per-camera sensor dropout (a blanked frame is a
  coverage gap, never a zero occlusion), via `dropout=`;
- seeded pixel noise + a slightly-wrong `assumed` calibration under calibration
  drift, via `noise=` — ground truth stays exact.

Moving occluders (a swept `HandOccluder`) are resolved to their per-frame solid
before any visibility test, so these labels track the occluder's true pose.

A downstream triangulator (the companion package
[multicam-occlusion](https://github.com/bamdadd/multicam-occlusion)) reads the
manifest, masks on `visible`, and recovers each 3D point from the cameras that
still see it. Because the calibration is written at full precision, it rebuilds
the projection matrices and recovers ground truth to about machine epsilon. That
round-trip is the point: occluded-in-one-view recovery, checked against truth.
See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the camera convention and the manifest schema.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest -q      # the smoke test triangulates a cam-occluded frame to ~1e-6
```

Build a scene and write its manifest:

```python
from multicam_sim import build_smoke_scene, write_manifest

scene = build_smoke_scene()          # 3 ring cameras, a moving point, one occluder
manifest = write_manifest(scene, "scene.json")
```

Because the manifest already carries every point's per-camera pixel and
visibility, it exports straight to 2D training annotations — the sim doubles as a
synthetic dataset generator. `write_coco` / `write_yolo` write COCO keypoint JSON
and per-image YOLO(-pose) TXT labels, one image per `(camera, frame)`, entity ids
as categories, and the COCO visibility flag (`2` visible / `1` occluded / `0`
out of view) derived from `in_view` / `visible`:

```python
from multicam_sim import build_manifest, build_pose_smoke_scene, write_coco, write_yolo

manifest = build_manifest(build_pose_smoke_scene())
write_coco(manifest, "annotations.json")   # COCO keypoint-detection JSON
write_yolo(manifest, "labels/")            # one YOLO .txt per image + classes.txt
```

A human pose is the same scene with a richer entity. It reuses the named-points
schema with no fork: a person is one entity with 17 COCO joints and a skeleton,
and every joint gets the same 3D / 2D / per-view occlusion labels as any point.

```python
from multicam_sim import PoseFrame, PoseTrajectory, Skeleton

joints = {j: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] for j in Skeleton.coco17().joints}
person = PoseTrajectory(id="p0", skeleton=Skeleton.coco17(), frames=[PoseFrame(frame=0, joints=joints)])
entity = person.to_entity()          # drops into a Scene like any object
```

## Scope

- **Geometry, not rendering.** OpenCV pinhole projection and ray-vs-solid
  occlusion (boxes and spheres). No textures, lighting, or GL.
- **Objects today, poses typed.** Object points work end to end. The COCO-17
  pose types and manifest labels are in place; SMPL / SMPL-X dense bodies are an
  open extension point (the `MeshBackend` ABC), not yet implemented.
- **Producer only.** multicam-sim emits manifests; triangulation and evaluation
  live in multicam-occlusion. The camera convention here is mirrored from that
  package so a manifest is consumed convention-for-convention.
